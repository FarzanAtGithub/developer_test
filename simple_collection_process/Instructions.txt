General Notes:
1) The code has been written in Java 7 (IFP.java)
2) To parse the HTML, Jsoup library has been used
3) To add the Jsoup library to the project, either download the .jar file (available in Jsoup folder) and or use POM.xml for 
maven dependency management. Both files have been copied to the Jsoup directory, and are also available from https://jsoup.org/download
4) Eclipse, NetBeans or ather IDEs or command prompt can be used to run the code (provided that Java already installed class path configured properly).
